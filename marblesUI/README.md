Please note there are multiple version of marbles. 
One for each major Hyperledger Fabric release. 
You must pick a version of marbles that is compatible with your version of Fabric.

## Application Background

Hold on to your hats everyone, this application is going to demonstrate transferring marbles between many marble owners leveraging Hyperledger.
We are going to do this in Node.js and a bit of GoLang. 
The backend of this application will be the GoLang code running in our blockchain network. 
From here on out the GoLang code will be referred to as 'chaincode' or 'cc'. 
The chaincode itself will create a marble by storing it to the chaincode state. 
The chaincode itself is able to store data as a string in a key/value pair setup. 
Thus, we will stringify JSON objects to store more complex structures. 

Attributes of a marble:

	1. name (unique string, will be used as key)
	1. color (string, css color names)
	1. size (int, size in mm)
	1. owner (string)
	
We are going to create a Web based UI that can set these values and store them in our blockchain. 
Start the tutorials below to have your own marbles blockchain demo!
