# zmarbles

The contents of this tar file work with Hyperledger Fabric v1.0.0

* zmarbles.tar  # `tar -xvf zmarbles.tar` to extract it in the directory of your choice

* zmarblesNPM.tar.gz  # `tar -xzvf zmarblesNPM.tar.gz` to extract it in the directory of your choice. If you do not have access to npm this tarball contains the node_modules directory inside of zmarbles/marblesUI directory that is, the 'npm install' has been done for you 

Use one of the two tarballs-   **zmarbles.tar** is preferred but see the notes above

**Q.** Why is one file .tar and the other .tar.gz?

**A.** This is only because GitHub has a 100MB file size limit so I had to compress zmarblesNPM.tar in order
to get it from about 160MB to about 40MB in size.
